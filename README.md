## Wanna Contribute?
 * Contributions are always welcome. Just make sure you're implementing an algorithm.
 * Language should be Java 
 * To add, follow the structure:

   > algorithm_type/algorithm_name/file_name.extension

 * If an implementation exists already in the language you chose, please don't make uneccesary PRs.
 * Do not remove previous implementations of algorithms. Just add a new file with your own implementation.
 * Beautify and clean up your code for easier reading
